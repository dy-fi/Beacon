USER STORIES

MVP
-Hey I'm Martin and I'm setting up a social gathering.  I use beacon to let my friends know where to go and where everyone is.

-Hey I'm Frieda and I'm meeting with friends.  My friends send me a beacon so I can see where we're meeting, who's already there, and
who is going to be.  Then the app gives me the fastest route automatically, but my friend wants me to pickup wine.  The app shows me
where my friend suggested, and gives me the fastest route to the store, and then to the meetup.  I get stuck in traffic but my friends
can see that it's because of traffic so they wait for me.
